	/*
	 * This is a Java class BoardFrame that extends the JFrame class and represents a GUI window for a chess game.

The class has a constructor that sets the default close operation of the frame to DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE, meaning that when 
the close button is clicked, the frame will be disposed and its resources will be released. The title of the frame is set
 to "Chess" and the resizability of the frame is set to false.

A Board component is created and added to the frame using the add method, with the BorderLayout.CENTER layout specified
, meaning that the component will be centered within the frame. The location of the frame is set to (200, 50) and the pack 
method is called to size the frame based on its components.
 Finally, the visibility of the frame is set to true to make it visible on the screen.
